        "content": "Mass Traffic is a kino-political theory of the 21st century. From political fictions to statistical abstractions, the book renders motion as a theoria complex. Concepts take the shape of brawl clouds and images surge as high-heat crispy formulations, reading the contemporary world through exponentiality and exuberance. Congestions of bureaucratic procedures meet the traffic of indeterminate actions—singing, swerving and dispersing across chapters on: organs; culture; the archive Infra-habibi-technics; the exhibitionary supply chain. Lantian Xie is an artist mobilising images, objects, things, things that happen, formulations, swerves, jumps, books, working groups, jazz bands, motorcycles, and parties. Sabih Ahmed is a curator moving between exhibitions, infra-/para-/axial-institutional appearances, archives, pedagogy, and theorisation.
